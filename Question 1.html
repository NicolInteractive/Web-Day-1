        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
            <p>Here, sleep</p>
            <p>At the bottom of Hell</p>
            <p>Your time has come to pick the road</p>      
            <p>You'll walk in this tale</p>
            <p>Turned</p>
            <p>And as a coward, you've learned</p>
            <p>Through sickness and health, there's only one</p>
            <p>Now go and bite your tongue</p>

        <h2>[Pre-Chorus]</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>You'll just say the worst of me, with a hope they'll understand</li>
            <li>No, they know you're just a boy, so grow up and be that man</li>
            <li>Little baby, kick and you scream and whine</li>
            <li>Victims pay the price, eventually</li>
            <li>The cost? Let's see... your life</li>
            <li>You've got nothing to prove</li>
            <li>Stay afraid, young brother</li>
            <li>You've got nothing to prove</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Your answer is in there, just stare down the barrel</li>
            <li>Your sincerest apologies won't write you out of this one</li>
            <li>Tonight, you'll find the right</li>
            <li>In the pull of the trigger, now bite</li>
            <li>Young fools</li>
            <li>Don't cry (Oh, oh)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
            A fear sleeps</p>
            Inside your stomach, it swells</p>
            A torn boy alone, in need of fix</p>
            And the pinch that cures the itch</p>
            For too long</p>
            This little baby's cried on</p>
            For tomorrow, we'll sing the words and song</p>
            Of a time we're glad's long gone</p>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
            Mother Superior, come catch the rabbit, he runs</p>
            My how've you been?</p>
            You're frightened of leaving this truly gone-fishing amalgam</p>
            Go fetch your gun</p>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
            Not anymore, don't cry, boy</p>
            Not anymore, don't cry, boy</p>
            Not anymore, don't cry, boy</p>
            When you're sick to the stomach, just pull out the knife, oh no</p>
            Don't cry, boy</p>
            Not anymore, don't cry, boy</p>
            Not anymore, don't cry, boy</p>
            When you're sick to the stomach, just pull out the knife, oh no</p>
